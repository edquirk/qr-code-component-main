## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive

### What I learned

I learned more than anything about Universal Selectors and how they effect different elements.  Thanks to some mentors on Frontend I was able to use some of it for this project.  I also learned more about Version Control and how to synchronize VS code with GitHub.

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to do the next challenge possibly using Flexbox or CSS Grid as I recently learned about this area of CSS.
